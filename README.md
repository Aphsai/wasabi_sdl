# wasabi_sdl

A sort of small engine implementing an entity component system.

It's for a game I'm not sure I'm going to make because I don't know if the idea is worth pursuing. I want more depth, perhaps. 
There's probably memory leaks here and there because I did this relatively off-the-cuff and not seriously. More of a learning
goal perhaps. But it works well! There's no lag with 2000+ entities that are all somewhat complex, the collision system is 
robust and predictable. It's easy to add new components and entities because of the flexibility in the architecture.
